Problem.

Three humans are escorting three slightly malfunctioning robots across a post-apocalyptic
landscape. They come to a river. There is a boat, capable of holding two but no more –
two humans, or two robots, or one of each. The boat needs at least one character in it to
steer it across the river. The robots are malfunctioning and could be dangerous to the humans
if they outnumber them in certain situations. The basic problem is how do all six characters
get across the river using the boat without the robots outnumbering the humans. You will
work with a more general version in which there can be different numbers of humans and robots.
This problem has a number of variants.

• There can be more robots than humans on one side of the river, but only if the boat
  is on that side too and all of the humans can escape in the boat. The robots must not
  outnumber the humans on the side of the river without the boat.

• The boat requires at least one human to steer it.

• Your representation will take the numbers of robots and of humans as a parameter. There
  could be different numbers of each. So, there could be 4 robots and 5 humans for example.
  You may assume there are at least as many humans as robots initially and there is at
  least one human. Possibly there are no robots.
  The problem does have a solution for three humans and three robots but not for all combinations
  of numbers.
